# About

You need to create .env so it could work correctly. Example:
```sh
BASEBRAINY="$HOME/Documents/BaseBrainy/"
BASEBRAINYREMOTE="remote:BaseBrainy/"

BASHSCRIPTS="$HOME/Documents/repos/bash_scripts/"
BASHSCRIPTSREMOTE="remote:bash_scripts/"

LOGSEQ="$HOME/Documents/LogseqVault/"
LOGSEQREMOTE="remote:LogseqVault/"

CLIENT_ID=""
CLIENT_SECRET=""
```

P.S. Scripts dont have shebang cause I'm using NixOS and.. usual shebangs don't work here.
